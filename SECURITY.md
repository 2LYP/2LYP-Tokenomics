## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the 2LYP Token smart contract or its architecture (vesting, airdrop, faucet, burn logic, etc.), we strongly encourage responsible disclosure.

### 📫 Contact

Please report vulnerabilities **privately**:

- 🛠 You may also message the maintainers privately on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/2LYP/people)

### 🔒 Disclosure Policy

- Do not open GitHub issues for vulnerabilities.
- Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until we have addressed them.
- We will acknowledge valid reports and fix confirmed issues as soon as possible.

This policy applies to the following:

- `/contracts/TwoLYPToken.sol`
- Vesting, faucet, airdrop, and burn logic
- Frontend integrations (if any are added later)
- Tokenomics behavior defined in `2lyp-tokenomics.pdf`

## Out of Scope

- Gas optimization suggestions (these are welcome, but not treated as vulnerabilities)
